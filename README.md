# ExProcess

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brain-geek/ex_process.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brain-geek/ex_process)

This project is intended to implement a BPM runner in Elixir language.

While it isn't planned to be as feature-packed as available enterprise competitors, it is intended to be flexible, configurable and easy to start.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bpmn` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_process, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/bpmn](https://hexdocs.pm/bpmn).
